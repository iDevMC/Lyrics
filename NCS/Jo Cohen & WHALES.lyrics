Run away, run away,
And i know, and i know, and know
Run away now
We can change anything, and make it better together
Now we're strong, don't question it.
The truth will break your chain.
We have the key (We have the key)
Open your eyes and see

We are ones that know the answers
And they ain't never gonna hold us back
The sea that's stretching like the dancers (ohh~, ohh~)
Imagine life without a purpose
Now picture everything you're fighting for (ohh~, ohh~)

Now picture everything you're fighting for.

Run away, run away
And time will find a place that we call home
Break a chain, anything.
We'll make it better together

Don't be afraid of letting go.
I know there more we can be free
Open your eyes and see

We are ones that know the answers
And they ain't never gonna hold us back
The sea that's stretching like the dancers (ohh~, ohh~)
Imagine life without a purpose
Now picture everything you're fighting for (ohh~, ohh~)

(Now picture everything you're fighting for~)
